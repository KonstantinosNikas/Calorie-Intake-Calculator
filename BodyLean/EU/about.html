        <div id="about">Which Should You Use for Calorie Counting?</div>
        <p><strong>BMR is More Directly Relevant:</strong></p>
        <p>For the purpose of counting calories and managing your diet, BMR (and by extension, TDEE) is more directly relevant. It gives you a baseline for how many calories you need to consume to maintain, lose, or gain weight. Adjustments can then be made based on your physical activity level and specific goals. <br></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Lean Body Mass Provides Additional Context:</strong></p>
        <p>While not directly used for calorie counting, knowing your body fat percentage can offer valuable insights into your overall health and help you set more specific body composition goals. It's useful for fine-tuning your diet and exercise approach, particularly if you're focused on altering your physique rather than just losing or gaining weight.</p>
